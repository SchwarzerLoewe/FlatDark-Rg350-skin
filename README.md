# FlatDark-Rg350-skin
I've decided to make a flat, windows 10 style skin for my personal use, but someone else may be interested in it. There will be other colors soon. 
I'm not planning on theming every emulator icon out there since there's way too many, the settings will be the only tab I'll create custom icons for. 

Feel free to modify and add your own! This can be done by tinting imgs\bottombar.png, imgs\topbar.png and the background image
